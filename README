Fastboot_ADB
======================

Some scripts for bootloader and recovery written in Batch. 
 
In the folder 'recovery' you will find the scripts for flashing CWM (Clock Work Mod Recovery) on your device. 
In the folder 'bootloader' you will find the script for bootloader's unlock. 

Obviously, you must have installed ADB and Fastboot on your computer. In the Android SDK's folders are already present.


Enjoy and flash!
